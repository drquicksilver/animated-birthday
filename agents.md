# Agent Contribution Guidelines

Before submitting a Pull Request (PR), **you must always**:

1. Run code linting:
   ```sh
   npm run lint
   ```
2. Run TypeScript type-checking:
   ```sh
   npm run type-check
   ```

Only submit your PR if both commands complete without errors. This ensures code quality and type safety for the project.
